    Of the Chinese animals only The Dog has an uncanny ability to sense danger.
    <br />
    <br />
    They will, almost instantly, decide whether a person is “friend” or “foe” and a situation or place is “good” or “bad” because, to this Chinese zodiac sign, there is no gray area. Ironically, their observations are usually spot on.
    <br />
    <br />
    With the Chinese Dog, what you see is what you get. They are transparent personalities who do not put on airs. They are warm, intelligent and generous.
    <br />
    <br />
    There is little more a Chinese Dog hates than cowardice, disloyalty and injustice. They believe everyone should be as responsible and honest as they are.
    <br />
    <br />
    Because of their inherent sense of duty, the Chinese Zodiac Dog often finds themselves in leadership roles even when they haven’t consciously pursued such a position.
    <br />
    <br />
    The Chinese Dog is fairly pessimistic and can also be prone to a bit of paranoia. Perhaps because they are always standing guard over their friends and family, they tend to expect trouble and, so, are constantly worried.
